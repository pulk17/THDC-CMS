## Getting Started

To get started with the THDC Complaint Management System, you'll need:

1. Node.js (v18 or higher)
2. MongoDB (local or Atlas connection)
3. Git

## Local Development

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Clone the Repository

cd THDC-CMS
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create config.env file with the following variables:
# PORT=6050
# MONGODB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
# JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
# ADMIN_REGISTRATION_CODE=your_admin_code

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

The backend server will start on http://localhost:6050.

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd ../frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file (optional)
# REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:6050

# Run development server
npm start
```

The frontend development server will start on http://localhost:3000.

## Non-Technical Breakdown

The THDC Complaint Management System is like a digital help desk for the organization. Here's how it works:

1. **Registration and Login**: Users create accounts or log in to access the system.

2. **Filing a Complaint**: 
   - Users fill out a simple form describing their issue
   - They can specify details like location, department, and urgency
   - Once submitted, the complaint is registered in the system

3. **Complaint Processing**:
   - Employees see new complaints on their dashboard
   - They review each complaint and assign it to an appropriate worker
   - The worker receives notification about the assigned task

4. **Tracking and Updates**:
   - Users can check the status of their complaints anytime
   - They can see who is working on their issue
   - They receive updates when the status changes

5. **Resolution**:
   - Once the issue is fixed, the worker marks it as resolved
   - The user can verify if the resolution is satisfactory
   - If not, they can reopen the complaint

6. **Management and Oversight**:
   - Administrators can see all activities in the system
   - They can manage users, workers, and employees
   - They can generate reports to identify common issues or bottlenecks

This system replaces traditional paper-based complaint handling with a streamlined digital process, making it faster and more transparent for everyone involved.
